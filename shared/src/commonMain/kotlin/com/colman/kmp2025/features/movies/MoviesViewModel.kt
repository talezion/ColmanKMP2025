üî• In-Class Talking Points: Flow vs StateFlow vs SharedFlow

| Type         | Hot/Cold | Use For                  | Key Property                           |
|--------------|----------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Flow         | Cold     | Streams, repositories     | Starts fresh for each collector        |
| StateFlow    | Hot      | UI state (e.g., counter)  | Always holds the latest value          |
| SharedFlow   | Hot      | One-time events (e.g., nav/snackbar)
                                  | Emits to all collectors; supports replay/buffer |

üëá Key behaviors to highlight during demo:
- Flow only runs when collected; suspending until then.
- StateFlow needs an initial value, emits immediately to collectors.
- SharedFlow doesn‚Äôt hold a value unless replay is used ‚Äî perfect for events.

‚úÖ Tip: use `collect`, `collectLatest`, or `onEach + launchIn(scope)` depending on use case.
